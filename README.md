## (Yet another) λ calculator...

Recently I came across Shriram Krishnamurti's lectures on YouTube [TODO: ref].
The course is called "Programming Languages - ..." [TODO: exact title]
and he's written a book of the same name that can be downloaded for free [TODO: ref].

While watching - and he's great teacher! - I said to myself: "Well, I should really
write my own programming language, eventually".

[TODO: not a new thought ... always wanted to do that ... well, ok, not so special I guess...]

[TODO: the course is using Racket [TODO: ref], 
which is derived from Scheme, 
which is derived from LISP,
which very closely resembles λ calculus]

So I grabbed the good old "Dragon Book" [TODO: ref].
And once again, while reading, I said to myself: "Why haven't I still not written
my own programming language?".
...which, of course, I've been saying to myself ever since I first read it.

BTW: YouTube also has videos of the old 80's lectures of ... and ... on which the Dragon
Book is based.

Then I pulled out Graham Hutton's "Programming in Haskell" [TODO: ref, YouTube again],
only to reach - shortly thereafter - for 
"Lambda-Calculus and Combinators - an Introduction" by Hindley & Seldin [TODO: ref].

So, finally, I'm giving it a try now. 

[TODO: why use Perl6?]

[TODO: link to Lambda-Intro.md, "covering pure λ with β/η-reduction and α-conversion]
